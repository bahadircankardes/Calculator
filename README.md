# CalculatorApp

This project is a simple calculator application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) by entering numbers and operators via a button-based interface. The eval() function is used to evaluate mathematical expressions, making it a practical exercise in front-end development and basic JavaScript logic.
